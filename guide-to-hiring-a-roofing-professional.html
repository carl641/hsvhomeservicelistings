                <h2>Executive Summary (TL;DR)</h2>
                <p>Roofing is frequently cited as the home service category most susceptible to fraud, particularly "storm chaser" scams following severe weather events in North Alabama. The primary regulatory threshold in Alabama is the $2,500 limit. Any residential roofing project exceeding $2,500 in cost requires a license from the Alabama Home Builders Licensure Board (HBLB). Homeowners can accept either a "Residential Roofers License" or an "Unlimited Home Builders License." Vetting must focus on filtering out transient, out-of-state operators who descend on Huntsville after tornadoes. Essential checks include verifying a permanent local business address, checking for the HBLB license, and ensuring the contractor carries a $10,000 license bond. Furthermore, homeowners must be vigilant against "deductible waivers," which constitute insurance fraud.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Deep Dive: Regulatory Framework and Vetting Protocol</h2>

            <h3>The $2,500 Threshold: A Legal Line in the Sand</h3>
            <p>While general home repairs have a $10,000 licensing exemption, roofing is treated with higher scrutiny. The Alabama Home Builders Licensure Board (HBLB) mandates that a residential roofer must be licensed if the undertaking exceeds $2,500.<sup>14</sup></p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Implication:</strong> Since the average roof replacement in Huntsville costs significantly more than $2,500, essentially every legitimate reroofing project requires a state-licensed contractor.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>License Types</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Residential Roofers License:</strong> Specific to roofing. Requires a $10,000 license/permit bond.<sup>14</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Unlimited Home Builders License:</strong> Allows the holder to build homes and perform roofing. This is also valid.<sup>16</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Limited Home Builders License:</strong> The holder of a Limited license must obtain a separate Roofers License to perform roofing work.<sup>16</sup></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Verification:</strong> Homeowners should verify the license status on the HBLB website. A contractor claiming "I don't need a license for this" is almost certainly violating state law.</p>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h3>The "Storm Chaser" Threat</h3>
            <p>Huntsville is located in a high-risk zone for tornadoes and hail. Following a major storm, the area is often flooded with "storm chasers"—contractors who travel from state to state following weather events.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>The Modus Operandi:</strong> These operators typically canvas neighborhoods door-to-door, pointing out "damage" and pressuring homeowners to sign immediate "contingency agreements."</p>
            </div>

            <h4>The Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Warranty:</strong> Once the crew moves to the next storm site (e.g., Oklahoma or Florida), the Huntsville homeowner has no way to enforce a workmanship warranty.</li>
                <li><strong>Subpar Work:</strong> Speed is prioritized over quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Red Flags</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Out-of-state license plates</li>
                <li>Lack of a local physical office (using a P.O. Box or hotel address)</li>
                <li>High-pressure tactics<sup>17</sup></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Vetting Strategy:</strong> Demand to see a current Huntsville or Madison Business License and ask for local references from jobs completed before the most recent storm.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h3>Insurance Fraud: The Deductible Waiver</h3>
            <p>A common tactic used by dishonest roofers is offering to "pay" or "waive" the homeowner's insurance deductible.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>The Law:</strong> It is illegal to profit from an insurance claim by inflating costs to cover the deductible. If a roofer offers to waive the deductible, they are implicating the homeowner in insurance fraud.<sup>17</sup></p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> A contractor willing to cheat an insurance company is also willing to cheat the homeowner on materials (e.g., using 15lb felt instead of synthetic underlayment). Legitimate companies will require the deductible be paid as part of the contract.</p>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h3>Financial Protection: Bonds and Lien Waivers</h3>
            <p>The Residential Roofers License requires a $10,000 bond naming the Board as the obligee.<sup>14</sup> This provides limited recourse.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Lien Waivers:</strong> The greater financial risk is a Mechanics Lien. If the roofer fails to pay their shingle supplier, the supplier can place a lien on the homeowner's house—even if the homeowner paid the roofer in full.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Protocol:</strong> Homeowners should require a "Release of Lien" or "Lien Waiver" from the material supplier before making the final payment to the roofer. This proves the materials have been paid for.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-takeaways">
                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strict Licensing Threshold:</strong> Any roofing job over $2,500 legally mandates a state license; reject any contractor who claims otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Presence Check:</strong> Prioritize companies with a permanent physical address in Madison County to avoid "storm chaser" operations that vanish after completing the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reject Fraudulent Offers:</strong> Immediately disqualify any roofer who offers to "waive" or "absorb" the insurance deductible, as this indicates participation in insurance fraud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lien Protection:</strong> Protect the property title by demanding lien waivers from material suppliers prior to releasing the final payment to the contractor.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
